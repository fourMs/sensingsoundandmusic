# Week 10: Physiology

## Physiological Reactions to Music

Music has a profound impact on the human body, eliciting various physiological responses. These reactions can include changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and even skin conductance.

## Skin Conductance
Skin conductance, a measure of emotional arousal, can change in response to music. Exciting or emotionally charged music may increase skin conductance, indicating heightened emotional engagement, while calming music may reduce it.


## Cardiac responses

### Heart Rate
Music can influence heart rate by either calming or exciting the listener. Slow, soothing music often reduces heart rate, promoting relaxation, while fast-paced or intense music can increase heart rate, reflecting heightened arousal or excitement.

### Shared Absorption and Cardiac Interrelations in String Quartets

Høffding et al. (2023) investigated the phenomenon of shared absorption and its impact on cardiac interrelations within expert and student string quartets. The study examined how group dynamics and collective focus influence physiological synchronization, particularly heart rate patterns, during ensemble performances. Findings suggest that shared absorption fosters a unique form of interpersonal connection, enhancing both musical cohesion and emotional engagement among performers.

### Cardiac Oscillations in Large Ensembles

Cardiac synchronization, the phenomenon where heart rate patterns align between individuals, has been observed in various musical contexts. Research highlights its occurrence both among performers and between performers and audiences, shedding light on the physiological and emotional connections fostered by music.

#### Synchronization Among Choristers
Müller and Lindenberger (2011) demonstrated that cardiac and respiratory patterns synchronize between individuals during choir singing. This synchronization reflects the deep interpersonal connection and shared focus required in ensemble performances, emphasizing the role of collective musical engagement in fostering physiological coherence.

#### Audience Synchronization During Performances
Czepiel et al. (2024) explored how piano performances can induce cardiac synchronization among audience members. Their findings suggest that audio-visual concert experiences create a shared physiological response, enhancing the collective emotional experience of the audience.

#### Open Questions
An intriguing question remains: how does cardiac coherence between musicians and audiences relate and evolve during a performance? Understanding this dynamic could provide deeper insights into the interplay of physiological and emotional connections in live musical settings.

### Heart Rate Variability

Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the variation in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats. It is an important indicator of autonomic nervous system activity and overall cardiovascular health. Music has been shown to influence HRV, with different types of music eliciting varying effects.

Relaxing music, such as classical or ambient genres, can increase HRV, indicating a shift towards parasympathetic nervous system dominance, which is associated with relaxation and stress reduction. On the other hand, stimulating or high-tempo music may decrease HRV, reflecting sympathetic nervous system activation, which is linked to heightened arousal or stress.

The impact of music on HRV is being explored in therapeutic contexts, such as stress management, anxiety reduction, and even cardiac rehabilitation, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive tool for improving well-being.

### Blood Pressure
Listening to music can also affect blood pressure. Relaxing music has been shown to lower blood pressure, which can be beneficial for stress relief. Conversely, loud or stimulating music may temporarily raise blood pressure.

## Respiration
Music can synchronize with breathing patterns. For example, slow tempos may encourage deeper, slower breaths, while faster tempos can lead to quicker, shallower breathing. This connection is often used in therapeutic settings to regulate respiration.


### Effects of Lung Volume on the Electroglottographic Waveform

Ternström, D’Amario, and Selamtzis (2018) investigated how lung volume influences the electroglottographic (EGG) waveform in trained female singers. Their findings revealed that lung volume significantly affects vocal fold behavior during phonation. Specifically, higher lung volumes were associated with increased subglottal pressure, which altered the EGG waveform characteristics. These changes suggest that lung volume plays a critical role in vocal control and may impact vocal performance and technique. The study highlights the importance of understanding respiratory mechanics in vocal training and pedagogy.

### Interperformer Coordination in Piano-Singing Duo Performances

D’Amario et al. (2023) explored the dynamics of interperformer coordination in piano-singing duo performances, focusing on how phrase structure and empathy influence synchronization. The study revealed that performers' ability to anticipate and adapt to each other's timing is crucial for achieving cohesive musical expression. Empathy between performers was found to enhance coordination, particularly during complex or expressive passages. These findings underscore the importance of interpersonal connection and shared musical understanding in collaborative performances.

## Measuring physiological data

### Equivital LifeMonitor

The Equivital LifeMonitor is a wearable physiological monitoring device designed to capture a range of biometric data, including respiration and heart rate. It is commonly used in research, healthcare, and performance monitoring due to its accuracy and portability.

The device uses respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) technology, which involves elastic bands embedded with sensors that measure the expansion and contraction of the chest and abdomen during breathing. By analyzing these movements, the LifeMonitor can determine respiratory rate and patterns.

The LifeMonitor employs electrocardiography (ECG) sensors to measure the electrical activity of the heart. These sensors are integrated into the chest strap, allowing the device to detect heartbeats and calculate heart rate. The ECG data can also provide insights into heart rate variability (HRV), which is an important indicator of autonomic nervous system activity.

The Equivital LifeMonitor is valued for its ability to provide continuous, real-time physiological data, making it a versatile tool for applications such as stress analysis, physical performance assessment, and medical research.
