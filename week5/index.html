This percept is often called the <em>perceptual center</em> (P-center) or <em>perceived attack time</em> (PAT): a subjective reference point that typically falls somewhere after physical onset and before the peak of the sound’s energy. As a result, sequences that are physically synchronous or physically isochronous may be heard as misaligned or uneven.</p><p>Studies show that certain sound parameters affect where P-centers are heard. Attack Duration or Time (time from onset to peak) is the strongest factor: <em>faster attacks</em> yield <em>earlier</em> P-centers; <em>slower attacks</em> yield <em>later</em> ones. Total duration (from onset to offset) exerts a weaker but similar influence—shorter sounds shift P-centers earlier; longer sounds shift them later.</p><img id="c0q73NrfS5" style="margin:0 auto" src="/sensingsoundandmusic/build/week5_image9-482abbc8ebd62c76b4cc0021b9516d13.png" data-canonical-url="figures/week5_image9.png" class=""/><p><em>Image Source: Guilherme Schmidt Camara 2025 ©</em></p><p>Take two guitar chords for example, one played by slowly arpeggiating the strings (“<em>swept</em>”) and one played fast by stroking all the strings in quick succession (“<em>swift</em>”).

A pulse can also describe an ongoing stream of beats (one can speak of 8th note pulses just as much as quarter note pulses). Regardless, the beat level of music is what we naturally tap our feet to, providing stability and predictability for both performers and listeners.</p><p>Research suggests that we comfortably perceive and move to beats when their IOI rate lies between about 500-700ms (120-86 BPM). Pulse is thus closely tied to our sensorimotor system—we tend to move along with it. Faster events are heard as subdivisions, and slower ones are grouped into larger spans.</p><p>In performance, the pulse may not always be physically marked by sound.

Accents are thought to align where metrical levels overlap. But in practice, this is not always how music is felt or performed. Many groove-based styles emphasize <em>off-beat positions</em>. In many popular genres such as rock, soul, and R&amp;B, the snare backbeats on 2 and 4 may feel more salient than beat 1. In reggae, the offbeats on the “ands” may dominate more than the downbeats.

They are common in Balkan, Middle Eastern, and contemporary art music traditions.</p><p>Performers often feel such meters as cycles of unequal steps rather than a uniform grid. The asymmetry can produce a sense of lilt or forward drive distinct from even meters.</p><p>In addition, the <em>inter-onset-interval</em> (<em>IOI</em>), or time duration, between the main beats in a meter may either be isochronous (equal), or non-isochronous (unequal). In many popular groove-based styles, instruments tend to create a highly isochronous beat structure. In Scandinavian folk styles such as Telespringar, the main beats of the meter are not always equal in duration, but instead can vary (e.g, long-medium-short), creating a signature lilting feeling to the music.</p><aside id="exercise-nonisochrony-tapping" class="myst-exercise my-5 shadow dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden dark:border-l-4 border-slate-400 dark:border-blue-500/60"><div class="myst-exercise-header m-0 font-medium py-2 flex min-w-0 text-md border-y dark:border-y-0 bg-blue-50/80 dark:bg-slate-900"><div class="myst-exercise-title text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words ml-4 group"><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal select-none hover:underline" href="#exercise-nonisochrony-tapping" title="Link to this Exercise" aria-label="Link to this Exercise">Exercise<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></div></div><div class="myst-exercise-body px-4"><p>Listen to an excerpt of a <em>springar</em> fiddle tune by Jon Vestafe (<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="/sensingsoundandmusic/build/week5_audio_ex_1_spr-9443d35997eca971d176abf38a38bbcf.mp3" class="">Audio Ex. 1</a></strong> – the first beat is marked by a synthetic voice for three measures to help you entrain to the beat).

Swing is commonly quantified in two ways: either as simply the absolute onset displacement (d) from a grid of an even-numbered/off-beat subdivision event (in milliseconds), or as the ‘<em>swing ratio</em>’ (R) between the relative duration of an odd-numbered subdivision event (m + d) and a subsequent even subdivision (m − d), where m is the mean inter-onset-interval (IOI) rate of the subdivision level (example 3). Swing ratios are thus calculated by the formula: 𝑅 = 𝑚 + 𝑑 / 𝑚 − 𝑑, and may be expressed as a ratio (e.g., 1.5:1 [‘medium swing’]) or more simply as a decimal (e.g., 1.5).</p><p>Overall, microrhythm can encompass both expressive moment-to-moment nuance and systematic patterns that recur across a piece or style. In many musical performance traditions, those systematic patterns often constitute the <em>norm</em> themselves, rather than representing “<em>deviations</em>” from ideal or perfect metronomic/isochronous timing.</p><h3 id="beat-delay-anticipation" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Beat Delay / Anticipation</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#beat-delay-anticipation" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Musicians may sometimes play <em>behind or ahead of the beat</em> in a <em>systematic</em> fashion—whether consciously or not. In rock and soul styles, snare drum strokes on beats 2 and 4 of a 4/4 meter are often claimed to be delayed, and in funk, downbeats are said to regularly anticipate “One”. It’s important to remember that what counts as “late” or “early” depends on a reference in any given context—whether kick, snare, or overall grid.</p><p>Different degrees of <em>beat delay/anticipation</em> are said to convey different types of ‘<em>feels</em>’. For example, delayed (late) back-beats in groove-styles are often described as “<em>Laid-back</em>”, and elicit a more “relaxed” feel when only slightly delayed, but a “heavy” or “dragging” feel if delayed too much. Anticipated (early) beats, on the other hand, are regularly described as “<em>On-top/Pushed</em>”, which at lower magnitudes might sound “snappy” and “driving”, but too much may sound “nervous” or “rushing”. Many scholars and musicians have attempted to develop their own heuristics as to what is the right degree of asynchrony in a given style. For example, MIDI-based electronic music producer Michael Stewart’s (in Prögler 1995) “feel spectrum,” which illustrates his prescriptions for an assortment of rhythmic feels at 130 beats per minute, for use with synthesizers and drum machines:</p><img id="C1uQDvXc6R" style="margin:0 auto" src="/sensingsoundandmusic/build/week5_image4-666702a841792df474fc74a514bcfe33.png" data-canonical-url="figures/week5_image4.png" class=""/><p><em>Image Source: adapted from Stewart (in Prögler 1995)<span id="fnref-xWu003DASe" class="" data-state="closed"><sup class="hover-link"><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal hover:underline" href="#fn-6" title="Link to Footnote" aria-label="Link to Footnote">[<!-- -->6<!-- -->]</a></sup></span></em></p><p>We can look at an example where Bootsy Collins (bassist from James Brown Band and Parliament-Funkadelic) is playing<span id="fnref-ZWfMg9cYdG" class="" data-state="closed"><sup class="hover-link"><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal hover:underline" href="#fn-7" title="Link to Footnote" aria-label="Link to Footnote">[<!-- -->7<!-- -->]</a></sup></span> along to a highly isochronous drum machine groove, which serves as a convenient stable time reference to measure bass onset asynchronies against (listen to <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="/sensingsoundandmusic/build/week5_audio_ex_3_rif-9bf879dcf7bd8aa94501f8a91cce3a82.wav" class="">Audio Ex. 3</a></strong>, where the 2-bar bass and drum riff is looped 3 times).

In funk/hip-hop, on the other hand, sixteenth notes tend to be swung at more subtle degrees (e.g., 1.2:1) unless played in explicit funk-shuffle styles (closer to 2:1, triplet).</p><p>Different swing ratios are thought to impart different degrees of “motional energy” to rhythms. Rhythms with lower swing ratios (closer to 1:1) are described as more “continuous” “driving”, or “propulsive”, whereas higher swing ratios (up to 2:1 and beyond) tend to impart “bounce” to “choppiness”, often accentuating the downbeats/on-beats of the meter.</p><p>Looking at Bootsy Collins’ performance again, instead of simply measuring how early or late the timing of bass onsets is on every note, we can calculate the swing ratio between all pairs of odd- and even-numbered subdivisions. We find that the bass swings rather significantly (mean: 1.4) over the course of the two bars, sometimes swinging more and sometimes less—arguably supplying the groove with a certain degree of “bounce”.

In general, however, asynchrony JNDs tend to depend strongly on instrument attacks and texture. With overlapping, sustained or blended tones (e.g., piano, strings, winds, voices), listeners typically need onsets to differ by roughly 20–50 ms before they hear them as asynchronous. In groove contexts that often involve sharper, more transient sounds (e.g., drums, picked bass), smaller onset displacements can be detected, around 10–20 ms for trained musicians.</p><p>As for swing JND thresholds, non-musicians tend to need around 30 ms (ca. 1.4) to hear rhythms as irregular (not straight/isochronous), while trained musicians can detect lower degrees of swing at around 10 ms displacement (about 1.1 - 1.2).</p><p>Other contextual factors can affect the extent to which we hear microrhythmic nuances.

This synchronization sets up <em>periodic peaks of attention</em>—expectancy moments where events are most salient—and these peaks are arranged in <em>hierarchies</em> (subdivision, tactus/beat, bar, larger cycles). In this view, meter is less a printed grid and more a <em>behavior of attention</em> that locks to temporal invariants and shapes how we group notes and hear accents.</p><p><em>Dynamic attending</em> theory attempts to explain where metrical accent “comes from” from a cognitive perspective. Not all accents are metrical: phenomenal accents (loudness, timbre, leaps) and structural accents (harmonic/melodic goals) can occur anywhere. <em>Metrical accent</em>, however, is said to arise when a rhythmic event lands <em>inside an attentional peak</em>—that is, it is <em>marked by consciousness</em>, not just made louder. Thus, a rock backbeat (dynamic emphasis on 2 and 4) need not move the metrical accent away from 1 and 3 for enculturated listeners; the listener’s entrainment maintains the meter while reading the backbeat as an idiomatic reinforcement.</p><img id="f73tM0zkdI" style="margin:0 auto" src="/sensingsoundandmusic/build/week5_image5-2f5697b490484fa954106cde04a6970f.png" data-canonical-url="figures/week5_image5.png" class=""/><p>Think of metrical accent strength as the <em>height and narrowness of an attention peak</em>.

The beat may be externalized (e.g., kick/snare backbeat in 4/4) or implied by cyclic “isoperiodic” figures that recur in a predictable fashion. Style identity often hinges on the <em>basic unit</em> (the smallest repeating chunk) and its <em>density referent</em> (the shortest practically used subdivision).</p><p>As performance, a groove is the coordinated realization of that basic unit across parts (e.g., drums, bass, guitar/keys, vocals). Players distribute roles: some layers reinforce the beat (e.g., kicks on beats 1 and 3, snare on 2 and 4), while others supply tension by playing on off-beat subdivisions (e.g., bass accentuating the ‘2-and’). Often, grooves balance stability (easily entrainable pulse) with off-beat rhythmic devices that supply interest and complexity, such as syncopation and cross-/counter-rhythm (see below).</p><h3 id="syncopation" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Syncopation</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#syncopation" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Syncopation is often described as a local contradiction of a metrical expectation scheme: a note occurring on a weak-position accent, a tie across a strong beat, or the omission of a strong beat followed by sound on a weak one. In 4/4, common cases include stressing the “and” of 2 or 4, tying into 1, or placing a salient event on 3-and while 3 itself is silent. Because the beat is usually firmly established in groove styles, such contradictions tend to add <em>tension</em> without destabilizing the meter.</p><p>Syncopation can arguably also <em>reinforce</em> meter—when an expected strong beat is left unarticulated, listeners feel the “missing” beat more vividly through anticipation; the follow-up weak-beat event then locks back to the underlying cycle. Backbeat-heavy styles illustrate this: dynamic accents on 2 and 4 do not move the downbeat to 2; instead, they clarify a beat-level ‘hocketing’ against the strong–weak–strong–weak scheme.</p><p>Once again, using Bootsy Collins’ bass performance as an example (bar 1 of the two-bar transcribed pattern below), looking at a simpler riff this time (<strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="/sensingsoundandmusic/build/week5_audio_ex_10_bo-104474b54efcb5b4de6851e6e2b3de00.wav" class="">Audio Ex. 10</a></strong>), we can see that he plays almost exclusively on the off-beat positions of the meter, hitting mainly the “-a” and “&#x27;-and” notes (think: 1-e-and-a, 2-e-and-a, etc.) with the exception of the “One”—a typical trait in funk music, where the downbeat is clearly marked in every repetition of the basic groove unit. Against the drums—which, conversely, are highly anchored to the main beats, featuring no syncopation on the 8th and 16th note subdivision level—the bass provides ample tension and rhythmic interest, without challenging the meter.</p><img id="NAMhw3ZQMZ" style="margin:0 auto" src="/sensingsoundandmusic/build/week5_image11-e089fb4df6e9bad19bd4e11c35498eb8.png" data-canonical-url="figures/week5_image11.png" class=""/><p><em>Image Source: Guilherme Schmidt Camara 2025 ©</em></p><h3 id="counter-cross-rhythm" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Counter-/Cross-Rhythm</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#counter-cross-rhythm" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>When syncopated events recur <em>systematically</em> within the basic unit, they may form larger-scale, patterned off-beat groupings that suggest alternative periodicities to the main beat.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-beat" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">Cross-rhythm</a> (often also called “polyrhythm”) occurs when these groupings display a systematic overlap of rhythmic streams whose periodicities (i.e., ‘metrical levels’) are noninteger multiples.

We will get back to that later in this course.</p><aside id="exercise-tap-bpm" class="myst-exercise my-5 shadow dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden dark:border-l-4 border-slate-400 dark:border-blue-500/60"><div class="myst-exercise-header m-0 font-medium py-2 flex min-w-0 text-md border-y dark:border-y-0 bg-blue-50/80 dark:bg-slate-900"><div class="myst-exercise-title text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words ml-4 group"><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal select-none hover:underline" href="#exercise-tap-bpm" title="Link to this Exercise" aria-label="Link to this Exercise">Exercise<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></div></div><div class="myst-exercise-body px-4"><p>Try determining the tempo of a song by tapping along to the beat using an online <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://taptempo.io/" class="">Tap-BPM tool</a>.</p><ul><li><p>Select a song and tap along to the beat; note the BPM value shown.</p></li><li><p>Try this with two songs at different tempi (one slow, one fast).</p></li><li><p>Listen for how the feel of swing or straight subdivisions changes with tempo.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Reflect:</strong> Did you notice that swing is easier to perceive at slower tempos?
