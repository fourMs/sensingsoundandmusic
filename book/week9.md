# Week 9: Vision

## Audiovisuality

### Physics

#### Signal
- **Light**: Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye. It plays a fundamental role in vision and is essential for perceiving the world around us. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light).
- **Sound**: Sound is a mechanical wave that propagates through a medium such as air or water. It is a key component of auditory perception and is used in communication, music, and environmental awareness. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound).

#### Representation
- **Audio**: Audio refers to sound that is recorded, transmitted, or reproduced. It is widely used in media, communication, and entertainment, enabling the sharing of information and experiences. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio).
- **Video**: Video is the recording, processing, and playback of moving visual images. It is a powerful medium for storytelling, education, and entertainment. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video).

### Psychology

#### Perception
- **Psychophysics**: Psychophysics is the study of the relationship between physical stimuli and the sensations and perceptions they produce. It helps in understanding how humans interpret sensory information. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics).
- **Psychoacoustics**: Psychoacoustics explores how humans perceive and interpret sound, including pitch, loudness, and timbre. It is crucial in fields like audio engineering and hearing science. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics).
- **Auditory perception**: Auditory perception involves the processing of sound by the auditory system, enabling humans to recognize and interpret sounds in their environment. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_perception).
- **Cognition**: Cognition encompasses mental processes such as perception, memory, and decision-making. It plays a significant role in how sensory information is interpreted and acted upon. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition).

#### Auditory-visual
- **Auditory-visual**: Auditory-visual integration refers to the brain's ability to combine auditory and visual information to enhance perception and understanding. This phenomenon is essential in activities like speech comprehension and multimedia experiences. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiovisual).

#### Multimodal
- **Multimodal**: Multimodal perception involves the integration of information from multiple sensory modalities, such as sight, sound, and touch, to create a cohesive understanding of the environment. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_perception).

#### Crossmodal
- **McGurk effect**: The McGurk effect is a perceptual phenomenon where conflicting auditory and visual stimuli result in a third, distinct perception. It highlights the complex interplay between sensory modalities. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGurk_effect).

## Psychology

### Gaze
Gaze refers to the direction in which a person is looking, often used as an indicator of attention and focus. It plays a crucial role in understanding human behavior, communication, and cognitive processes. Gaze tracking is commonly used in psychological studies to analyze visual attention and social interactions. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze).

### Pupillometry
Pupillometry is the measurement of pupil size and reactivity, often used to study cognitive and emotional processes. Changes in pupil size can indicate arousal, attention, and mental effort. This technique is widely applied in psychology, neuroscience, and human-computer interaction research. [Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillometry).

## Technology

### Eye-Trackers

Eye-trackers are devices used to measure eye positions and movements. They are widely used in research fields such as psychology, neuroscience, marketing, and human-computer interaction. Eye-trackers can be categorized into two main types: mobile and stationary.

#### Mobile Eye-Trackers
Mobile eye-trackers are wearable devices that allow for the tracking of eye movements in real-world environments. These devices are often used in studies that require participants to move freely, such as sports performance analysis, usability testing, and outdoor experiments.

#### Stationary Eye-Trackers
Stationary eye-trackers are fixed devices typically used in controlled laboratory settings. They are often mounted on a desk or integrated into a monitor and are used for tasks such as reading studies, visual search experiments, and website usability testing.
