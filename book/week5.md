# Week 5: Time and Rhythm

## Time
Time in music refers to the organization of sounds and silences in a temporal framework. It is the foundation upon which rhythm, beat, and meter are built.

## Beat
The beat is the basic unit of time in music, often described as the "pulse" listeners tap their feet to. It provides a steady framework for the rhythm. [Learn more about beat on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)).

## Pulse
Pulse refers to the regular, repeating beats in a piece of music. It is what gives music its sense of forward motion and predictability. [Read more about pulse on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(music)).

## Meter
Meter is the recurring pattern of stresses or accents that provide the pulse of the music. It organizes beats into measures or bars. 

### Asymmetric Meter
Asymmetric meter refers to meters that do not divide evenly into groups of two or three beats. For example, the song "Ma√Ætre Gnome" features an asymmetric meter. [Explore asymmetric meter on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(music)#Asymmetric_meter).

## Rhythm
Rhythm is the pattern of sounds and silences in music, created by the arrangement of notes of varying lengths. It is one of the most fundamental aspects of music. [Discover more about rhythm on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm).

## Tempo
Tempo refers to the speed at which a piece of music is played, typically measured in beats per minute (BPM).

### Spontaneous Tempo
Spontaneous tempo is the natural pace at which an individual might tap or move to music without external guidance.

### Tap BPM
Tap BPM is a method of determining the tempo of a piece of music by tapping along with the beat. [Learn about tempo on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo).

## Entrainment
Entrainment in music refers to the synchronization of an individual's movements or internal rhythms with an external rhythm, such as a musical beat. [Read about entrainment on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_(biomusicology)).

## Shape
Shape in music refers to the contour or form of a musical phrase or section, often influenced by dynamics, pitch, and rhythm.

## Groove
Groove is the sense of rhythmic feel or swing in music that compels listeners to move or dance. It is often associated with genres like funk, jazz, and R&B. [Explore groove on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music)).

## Structured Patterns in Time
Structured patterns in time refer to the deliberate organization of rhythms and beats to create a cohesive musical piece. These patterns form the backbone of musical compositions.
