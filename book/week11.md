# Week 11: Machine Listening

## Machine Listening

Machine listening is a field of study that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and analyze audio signals. It has applications in various domains, including music, speech, and environmental sound analysis.

### Information Retrieval

Information retrieval in machine listening involves extracting meaningful information from audio data. Key areas include:

- **Classification**: This involves categorizing audio into predefined classes, such as:
    - [Genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre)
    - [Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument)
    - [Mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology))
- **Recommendation**: Systems that suggest music or audio content based on user preferences. Learn more about [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system).
- **Source Separation**: The process of isolating individual sound sources from a mixture. See [source separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing#Source_separation).
- **Transcription**: Converting audio into symbolic representations like sheet music. Learn about [music transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_transcription).
- **Question-Answering**: Systems that answer questions based on audio content.
- **Segmentation**: Dividing audio into meaningful segments, such as verses or choruses in music.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting characteristics like pitch, tempo, or timbre from audio. See [audio feature extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction).

### Data

Machine listening relies on various types of data:

- **Symbolic Data**: Representations like [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) and [MusicXML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicXML).
- **Subsymbolic Data**: Includes raw audio, video, and sensor data.
- **Metadata**: Information about the audio, such as artist or album details. Learn about [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata).
- **Paradata**: Data about the process of data collection or analysis.
- **User Data**: Information about user interactions and preferences.


### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI techniques in machine listening can be categorized as:

- **Rule-Based Systems**: Systems that rely on predefined rules and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics).
- **Learning-Based Systems**: Systems that use machine learning to adapt and improve. Learn about [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

### Time

Machine listening systems can operate in different time modes:

- **Realtime**: Systems that process audio as it is received, such as [online systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing).
- **Non-Realtime**: Systems that process audio after it has been recorded, such as [offline systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing).
