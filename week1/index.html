Humans <em>sense</em> sound through our auditory system, but as we will discuss throughout the course, also through our bodies. Exactly how we “sense” music is still one of the core questions of both musicology at large and music psychology more specifically. It is also of interest in music technology.</p><p>Research in music psychology highlights how humans perceive and process sound, exploring topics such as pitch, rhythm, timbre, and harmony. Technological advancements, such as digital audio workstations and sound synthesis, have expanded the boundaries of music creation and analysis, enabling new forms of artistic exploration.</p><h2 id="an-interdisciplinary-approach" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">An interdisciplinary approach</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#an-interdisciplinary-approach" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>This course aims to be <em>interdisciplinary</em>, meaning that it draws on methods, theories, and perspectives from multiple academic fields to address complex questions about sound and music. Interdisciplinarity goes beyond simply combining knowledge from different areas; in this case, between musicology, psychology, and technology. The idea is that by approaching sound and music from these varied viewpoints, we gain a richer understanding of how humans perceive, experience, and create music, as well as how technology can enhance and transform these processes.</p><h3 id="some-etymology" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Some etymology</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#some-etymology" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">Etymology</a> is the study of the origin and history of words and how their meanings and forms have changed over time. The word “etymology” is itself derived from the Ancient Greek words ἔτυμον (étymon), meaning ‘true sense or sense of a truth’, and the suffix -logia, denoting ‘the study or logic of’. Similarly, we can investigate the three disciplines in question:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Musicology</strong>: The term “musicology” comes from the Greek words <em>mousikē</em> (music) and <em>-logia</em> (study or science). It is the scholarly study of music, covering its history, theory, and cultural context. Musicologists analyze how music is composed, performed, and understood across different societies and eras.</p></li><li><p><strong>Psychology</strong>: “Psychology” is derived from the Greek <em>psyche</em> (soul, mind) and <em>-logia</em> (study). It is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. In the context of music, psychology explores how people perceive, process, and respond to music emotionally and cognitively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Technology</strong>: The word “technology” originates from the Greek <em>techne</em> (art, craft, skill) and <em>-logia</em> (study). Technology refers to the tools, techniques, and systems humans create to solve problems or enhance capabilities. In music, technology includes instruments, recording devices, software, and other innovations that help create, analyze, or experience music.</p></li></ul><aside class="myst-admonition myst-admonition-note my-5 shadow-md dark:shadow-2xl dark:shadow-neutral-900 bg-gray-50/10 dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden myst-admonition-default rounded border-l-4 border-blue-500 question"><div class="myst-admonition-header m-0 font-medium py-1 flex min-w-0 text-lg text-blue-600 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-slate-900"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="2rem" height="2rem" class="myst-admonition-header-icon inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none text-blue-600"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="m11.25 11.25.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Zm-9-3.75h.008v.008H12V8.25Z"></path></svg><div class="myst-admonition-header-text text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words">Question</div></div><div class="myst-admonition-body px-4 py-1"><p>Can you think of other words with a “logy” at the end?

Multidisciplinary collaboration involves people from different disciplines working together, each drawing on their own expertise. Interdisciplinary work integrates knowledge and methods from multiple disciplines, synthesizing approaches for a deeper understanding. Transdisciplinary approaches go further, creating unified intellectual frameworks that transcend individual disciplinary boundaries.</p><p>One approach is not better than another, and many researchers combine their approach depending on the project type. Still, it is helpful to consider these differences as we approach each discipline and look at how they combine theories and methods.</p><aside class="myst-admonition myst-admonition-note my-5 shadow-md dark:shadow-2xl dark:shadow-neutral-900 bg-gray-50/10 dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden myst-admonition-default rounded border-l-4 border-blue-500 question"><div class="myst-admonition-header m-0 font-medium py-1 flex min-w-0 text-lg text-blue-600 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-slate-900"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="2rem" height="2rem" class="myst-admonition-header-icon inline-block pl-2 mr-2 self-center flex-none text-blue-600"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="m11.25 11.25.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Zm-9-3.75h.008v.008H12V8.25Z"></path></svg><div class="myst-admonition-header-text text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words">Question</div></div><div class="myst-admonition-body px-4 py-1"><p>How do you define your own background in terms of disciplinarity?</p></div></aside><h3 id="concepts-theories-methods" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Concepts, theories, methods</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#concepts-theories-methods" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>An academic discipline is generally characterized by a distinct set of concepts, theories, and methods that guide inquiry and knowledge production within a particular field.

Music psychology is primarily a <em>scientific</em> field of study, focused on understanding how humans perceive, process, and respond to music through empirical research and theoretical frameworks. Its methods are rooted in experimental design, data analysis, and psychological theory, aiming to uncover universal principles and individual variations in musical experience.</p><p>Music technology, on the other hand, spans several domains: science, art, design, and engineering. It encompasses scientific research into sound and audio processing, artistic exploration through composition and performance, design of musical instruments and interfaces, and engineering of hardware and software systems. Music technologists may work on developing new tools for music creation, analyzing audio signals, designing interactive installations, or exploring creative possibilities in digital media. This diversity means that music technology is not limited to scientific inquiry but also includes creative practice, technical innovation, and user-centered design.</p><p>Given its many directions, music technologists typically work in many different types of departments: computer science, electrical or mechanical engineering, design and art schools, as well as within musicology departments and music conservatories. As for psychologists, this institutional basis often also influences the directions taken.</p><h2 id="listening-to-the-world" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Listening to the world</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#listening-to-the-world" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>We will spend next week’s class only on listening, but we will start with a little warm-up here. After all, listening is an essential human capacity and central to music. However, most people do not think much about listening in daily life, except for when it is annoying. Too low sound is difficult to hear what is said, and too low sound is unpleasant and even dangerous. But why is that, and how do we talk about it in precise terms? That is what we will explore both here and later in class.</p><aside id="exercise-cgpuetzlng" class="myst-exercise my-5 shadow dark:bg-stone-800 overflow-hidden dark:border-l-4 border-slate-400 dark:border-blue-500/60"><div class="myst-exercise-header m-0 font-medium py-2 flex min-w-0 text-md border-y dark:border-y-0 bg-blue-50/80 dark:bg-slate-900"><div class="myst-exercise-title text-neutral-900 dark:text-white grow self-center overflow-hidden break-words ml-4 group"><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit font-normal select-none hover:underline" href="#exercise-cgpuetzlng" title="Link to this Exercise" aria-label="Link to this Exercise">Exercise<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></div></div><div class="myst-exercise-body px-4"><p>Stand up.

For example, background noise in a café or the hum of an air conditioner.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selective hearing</strong>: The ability to focus on specific sounds or voices while ignoring others, such as following a conversation in a noisy environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Active listening</strong>: Engaging attention and intention to understand, analyze, or respond to sounds or speech. This is essential in music appreciation, communication, and learning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical listening</strong>: Evaluating and analyzing sound quality, musical structure, or meaning, often used in music production, performance, or academic study.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empathetic listening</strong>: Focusing on the emotional content and intent behind sounds or speech, important in social interactions and therapeutic contexts.</p></li></ul><p>It is important to note that the mechanisms underlying these different approaches to hearing and listening are still actively researched. So there are many—sometimes diverging—opinions about them, their differences, and how they overlap or connect. In any case, understanding these distinctions helps clarify how we interact with sound and music, moving from automatic sensory processing to deeper engagement and interpretation.</p><h3 id="embodied-music-cognition" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Embodied music cognition</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#embodied-music-cognition" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>The approach to human psychology presented in this book is not neutral (not that any other book is that, either, even though they pretend to be).

Several researchers at the University of Oslo—with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.hf.uio.no/imv/english/people/aca/emeriti/rolfig/index.html" class="">Professor emeritus Rolf Inge Godøy</a> in front—have been active in developing this branch of research over the last decades. The approach has been foundational to the studies of music-related body motion in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://fourms.uio.no" class="">fourMs Lab</a> and is also at the core of many activities at <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/" class="">RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies of Rhythm, Time and Motion</a>.</p><p>The core idea of embodied music cognition is that both the production and perception of music are based on integrating sensory, motor, and emotional dimensions. To paraphrase the father of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_psychology" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">“ecological psychology”</a>, James Gibson, you explore the world with eyes in a head on a body that moves around. He was mainly interested in visual perception, but his ideas have inspired a similar thinking about other senses.</p><p>A different entry point to a similar idea is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Small#Musicking" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed"><em>musicking</em></a>. This term popularized by musicologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Small" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">Christopher Small</a>, who argued that music is best understood as a verb—to music—not a noun <span class="text-yellow-600" title="Citation Not Found"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" width="1rem" height="1rem" class="inline mr-1"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M12 9v3.75m9-.75a9 9 0 1 1-18 0 9 9 0 0 1 18 0Zm-9 3.75h.008v.008H12v-.008Z"></path></svg>small_musicking_1998</span>. Music is not an object or a finished product (like a song or a score), but rather an activity—something people do. When a band plays a concert, the musicians, the dancers, the audience, the sound engineers, and even the people selling tickets and cleaning the hall are all engaged in musicking. The music exists not just in the notes played, but in the shared experience and interaction.</p><p>Researchers within embodied music cognition are eager to not only study “the music” but instead explore the complexity of musical interactions, from the role of gestures in musical performance to how perceivers synchronize their bodies to a musical beat. By engaging the body, embodied music cognition provides a holistic framework for studying how music is experienced and understood.</p><h3 id="multimodality" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Multimodality</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#multimodality" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p><em>Multimodality</em> is a core feature of embodied music cognition and refers to the integration and interaction of multiple sensory modalities in the perception and understanding of the world. This table summarizes the main human senses, their associated sensory modalities, and the organs involved in each.</p><table class=""><tbody><tr class=""><th class="">Sense</th><th class="">Modality</th><th class="">Human Organ(s)</th></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Hearing</td><td class="">Auditory</td><td class="">Ears</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Sight</td><td class="">Visual</td><td class="">Eyes</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Touch</td><td class="">Tactile</td><td class="">Skin, Hands</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Taste</td><td class="">Gustatory</td><td class="">Tongue, Mouth</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Smell</td><td class="">Olfactory</td><td class="">Nose</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Balance</td><td class="">Vestibular</td><td class="">Inner Ear</td></tr><tr class=""><td class="">Proprioception</td><td class="">Kinesthetic</td><td class="">Muscles, Joints</td></tr></tbody></table><p>From a psychological perspective, multimodality emphasizes how the brain combines information from these different sensory channels to create a cohesive and enriched experience. In the context of music cognition, this could involve the interplay between auditory and motor systems, such as how visual cues from a performer influence the perception of sound or how physical gestures enhance musical expression and understanding. However, the other senses are also involved. Touch provides tactile feedback for instrumentalists and singers; proprioception and balance help musicians coordinate movement and posture, especially in dance or performance; and even smell or taste can contribute to the emotional context and memory of musical events. These multisensory interactions enrich both performance and perception, deepening engagement for musicians and audiences alike.</p><p>Most people agree that sound is a core component of music, yet there are notable examples of musicians and composers who have created and performed music despite significant hearing loss. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>, one of the most influential composers in Western music history, continued to compose groundbreaking works even after becoming profoundly deaf. In more recent times, percussionist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Glennie" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">Evelyn Glennie</a> has demonstrated that musical experience and expression are not limited by the ability to hear sound in a conventional way. Glennie, who lost most of her hearing by the age of twelve, developed unique techniques to sense vibrations through her body, allowing her to perform and interpret music at the highest level. These examples challenge traditional notions of music as purely an auditory phenomenon and highlight the importance of multimodal and embodied approaches to musical experience.</p><div style="text-align:center" class="leading-[0]"><div class="relative inline-block" style="padding-bottom:60%;width:min(max(100%, 500px), 100%)"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/evelyn_glennie_how_to_truly_listen" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay" style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;border:none"></iframe></div></div><h3 id="action-and-perception" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Action and Perception</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#action-and-perception" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>The last concept we will introduce this week is the <em>action–perception loop</em>. The idea of embodied cognition in general is that we sense through action, and act through sensing. In music, the action-perception loop is evident in activities such as playing an instrument, where sensory feedback informs motor actions, and vice versa. For example, a pianist adjusts their touch based on the sound produced, creating a continuous cycle of interaction.</p><img id="M0AanI4tPQ" style="margin:0 auto" src="/sensingsoundandmusic/build/action-cognition-bf5aef71713ff62ac8bfbf614f9c830e.png" alt="Action–perception loop" data-canonical-url="figures/action-cognition.png" class=""/><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clarke" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">Eric Clarke</a> has used the action–perception loop as core to his thinking about <em>ecological listening</em>. He bridges psychology, musicology, and acoustic ecology, offering insights into how humans engage with sound as part of their lived experience. In his influential book <em>Ways of Listening</em>, he argues for three different listening modes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Direct perception</strong>: Listeners perceive sounds in relation to their environment without needing extensive cognitive processing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Affordances</strong>: Sounds provide cues about actions or interactions possible within a given environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contextual listening</strong>: The meaning of sounds is shaped by their environmental and situational context.</p></li></ul><p>As we will see next week, there are many similar ways of thinking about how we listen.</p><h2 id="questions" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Questions</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit
